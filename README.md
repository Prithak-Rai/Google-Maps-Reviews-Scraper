# Google-Maps-Reviews-Scraper
This Python script uses SerpAPI to scrape Google Maps reviews for a given place_id. It handles pagination with next_page_token to collect all reviews, extracting the userâ€™s name, profile link, rating, and snippet. The reviews are saved to a CSV file for easy analysis, with a brief delay between requests to ensure smooth data retrieval.
